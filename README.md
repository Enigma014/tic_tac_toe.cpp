<h1 style="font-size: 36px;">MiniMax Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Welcome to MiniMax Tic-Tac-Toe, a simple console-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using the MiniMax algorithm. This project demonstrates the basic principles of artificial intelligence (AI) in gaming.

<h2>Features</h2>
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a computer opponent.
Computer uses the MiniMax algorithm to make optimal moves.
Console-based interface for easy interaction.
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
To compile and run this program, you'll need:

C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
Command-line environment (e.g., Terminal on macOS/Linux or Command Prompt on Windows)
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
Clone this repository to your local machine:


```git clone https://github.com/Enigma014/tic_tac_toe.cpp/edit/main/README.md```

Navigate to the project directory:


```cd tic_tac_toe```

Compile the program:


```g++ main.cpp -o tic_tac_toe```

Run the game:


```./tic_tac_toe```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the computer.

<h2>How to Play</h2>
You are 'X,' and the computer is 'O.'
Enter your move by specifying the row and column (e.g., "1 2" for the first row, second column).
The computer will respond with its move, and the game continues.
The game will end when there is a winner or a draw.
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
The computer uses the MiniMax algorithm to determine its moves. This algorithm ensures that the computer always plays optimally and makes it impossible to beat.
